## packets_1d.txt Sample
Sample generated by the bitstream decoder when decoding `bitstream_1.txt`.

It matches the direwolf output, with few differences:
- 0x0d and 0x0a are replaced by `<CR>` and `<LF>` for readability 
- 0x1c, 0x1d, 0x7f, 0x1f, 0x1e and 0x20 are unescaped
- The digipeater path are written as is, Direwolf only prints the last Digipeater address as set, even if this is not how the packet was decoded
- Bytes > 0x7F are output as raw bytes; Direwolf assumes CP437 encoding and converts to UTF-8. This causes display differences on Windows consoles:
  - `0xF8` → raw: `ø` (CP1252) vs Direwolf: `Â°` (UTF-8 misread)
  - `0xBE` → raw: `¾` (CP1252) vs Direwolf: `â•›` (UTF-8 misread)
  - `0x9F 0x80` → raw: `Ÿ€` (CP1252) vs Direwolf: `Æ'Ã‡` (UTF-8 misread)
